I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Gauhati University, Assam and Master of Engineering degree in Information and Communication Technologies from the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand. I received my Ph.D. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Silchar, India in 2022. My Ph.D thesis is titled "Pattern Recognition Based on Microwave Signal Using Artificial Intelligence" where I worked on pattern recognition based on antenna's reactive's field for applications like Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Machine Health Monitoring. My research work is interdisciplinary and I am particularly interested in exploring the use of antenna and AI technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of activity recognition systems. The question is: does an antenna have the potential to become a low-cost sensor to recognize physical phenomena using AI to explore the concrete applications of HAR on healthcare, machine health monitoring, etc.?

I joined Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in May 2022 as a post doctoral researcher. I developed archival content retrieval system based on text/audio query for Prasar Bharati and I played a leading role in handling deployment of AI model for Prasar Bharati's multimedia for efficient search and recommendation. My postdoctoral research work emphasizes on the significance of learning to hash for approximate nearest neighbor search in massive scale multimedia retrieval.

I am deeply interested in exploring cross-modal challenges in activity and music domains, aiming to leverage multi-modal information retrieval techniques to address complex research problems.
