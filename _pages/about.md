I received my Ph.D. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Silchar, India (2022). My dissertation, _Pattern Recognition Based on Microwave Signal Using Artificial Intelligence_, focused on pattern recognition using antenna reactive fields, with applications in human activity recognition (HAR) and machine health monitoring.

Following my Ph.D., I joined the [Madhav Lab](https://madhavlab.github.io/) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur as a Post-Doctoral Fellow, where I worked at the intersection of machine learning and audio signal processing. Drawing on my training as a Western classical guitarist, my research naturally shifted towards music information retrieval (MIR). At IIT Kanpur, I developed and deployed an audio-based recommendation system for Indiaâ€™s national broadcaster, Prasar Bharati, leading the integration of AI models for large-scale multimedia search and recommendation.

I am currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/), University of Oslo, Norway. My present research focuses on rhythmic analysis of music and dance, with an emphasis on multimodal synchronization. Specifically, I am working on learning-based methods for estimating dance tempo directly from motion-capture data, developing adaptive algorithms that integrate rhythmic information across multiple body segments to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse dance genres.

# Research Interest:

My research lies at the intersection of **machine learning, audio signal processing, and music information retrieval**, with a special focus on **rhythmic analysis of music and dance**. I develop learning-based methodologies for audio and movement analysis, exploring multimodal synchronization between music and the body. Currently, I am investigating approaches that integrate motion-capture data with musical structure, advancing applications in **dance information retrieval** and **multimodal interaction**.
